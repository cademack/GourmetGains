# GourmetGains
A web app based on the Ruby on Rails framework that helps users find what workouts they should do and submit workout ideas for others.

#Key Features:
Users can submit workouts (Ex: Dumbbell curl, Barbell Bench Press) and then along with the name, the user can also submit a link to a page explaining the workout, and the user must tag the muscle groups that the workout targets.

Users can view all the submitted workouts

Users can input what muscle groups they would like to target and how long of a workout they want. Then the application should be able to generate a workout that hits all those groups.
